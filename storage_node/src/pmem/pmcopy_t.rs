//! This file contains the trusted specification of several traits that 
//! help us prove that reading from PM is safe. Some of the traits in this 
//! file correspond to macros defined in the `pmcopy` crate in this repository.
//! It is also related to some external traits defined and specified 
//! in pmem/traits_t.rs.
//! 
//! Both reading and writing to PM is potentially dangerous; this file 
//! focuses on ensuring that reads are safe. We want to be able to 
//! read bytes from PM and then cast them to some target type T,
//! but this may result in undefined behavior if the bytes are 
//! an invalid T value. Thus, before doing such a cast, we 
//! need to be sure that 1) the bytes we are reading have been 
//! properly initialized with a valid T and 2) they have not been
//! corrupted. 
//! 
//! We also need to be sure that proofs use the correct size for T.
//! This is tricky, because Verus has no way of obtaining the size 
//! in bytes of a structure. Rust's std::mem::size_of function
//! can give the size of a type in constant contexts, but this is 
//! an exec function that cannot be used in spec or proof code.
//! 
//! This file contains the `PmCopy` trait, which indicates whether
//! a type is safe to copy from PM and defines some methods and 
//! axioms for dealing with such structures.
