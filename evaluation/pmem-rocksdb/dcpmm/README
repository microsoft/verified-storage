This directory contains the DCPMM extensions needed to make rocksdb store
files in PMEM-awared filesystem.

It has been compiled and testing against Linux 4.10 + ext4 with -o dax.

The configuration assumes that packages libpmem and libpmemobj are installed.

The env_dcpmm.h file defines the rocksdb objects that are needed to talk to an
underlying filesystem.

If you want to compile rocksdb with dcpmm support, please set the make argument:
   ROCKSDB_ON_DCPMM=1
