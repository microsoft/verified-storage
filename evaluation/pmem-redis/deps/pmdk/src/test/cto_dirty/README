Persistent Memory Development Kit

This is src/test/cto_dirty/README.

This directory contains a unit test for the libpmemcto library.
It verifies that the inconsistent pool cannot be open. I.e. if it
wasn't gracefully closed and flushed to persistence entirely.

The program in cto_dirty.c takes a filename and optionally the number
indicating when to simulate the failure. For example:

	./cto_dirty testfile 1

will create (or open) a pmemcto pool on testfile, and then call exit()
to simulate application crash.
