// This function is used by the PmSafe derive macro to check whether 
// a deriving type is, in fact, PmSafe. This requires two main checks:
// 1. The type must be repr(C). This is not really a strict requirement for 
//    writing to PM -- as long as we know the size of a type, it may have any
//    in-memory layout when writing to PM -- but it makes it easier to determine
//    the size, and other safety-related traits require this as well.
// 2. All fields of the deriving type must be PmSafe. PmSafe primitive types are
//    defined in storage_node/src/pmem/traits_t.rs. 
// 
// The repr(C) requirement is checked by checking the attributes of the deriving type.
// The PmSafe fields requirement is performed by adding trivial trait bounds to
// the unsafe implementation of PmSafe generated for the deriving type.
// For example, the generated implementation of PmSafe for the following type:
// ```
// struct Foo {
//      val1: u8,
//      val2: u16,
//      val3: u32
// }
// ```
// would look like:
// ```
// unsafe impl PmSafe for Foo
//      where u8: PmSafe, u16: PmSafe, u32: PmSafe {}
// ```
// These trait bounds are easily checkable by the compiler. Compilation will
// fail if we attempt to derive PmSafe on a struct with a field of type, e.g., 
// *const u8, as the bound `const *u8: PmSafe` is not met.
