This is examples/libvmem/README.

This directory contains examples for libvmem, the library providing
a volatile memory allocator for persistent memory.  Some examples
are described in more detail here: http://pmem.io/pmdk/libvmem

manpage.c is the example used in the libvmem man page.

To build these examples:
	make

These examples can be built against an installed system using:
	make LIBDIR=/usr/lib INCDIR=/usr/include
