//! This file defines external and unsafe traits PmSized 
//! and PmSafe that are used to prove that accesses to PM
//! are safe. Aside from the hardcoded unsafe implementations
//! in this file, these traits should *ONLY* be implemented
//! via derive macros, which are defined in the pmcopy crate.
//! 
//! Both reading and writing to PM are potentially dangerous
//! operations. It is not crash-safe to write a structure with
//! references to external resources (e.g., references, raw pointers,
//! file descriptors), as these resources may be lost in a crash,
//! causing a dangling reference upon recovery. The PmSafe marker
//! trait establishes which types are safe to write to PM and can
//! only be derived for safe types.
//! 
//! To read safely from PM, we need to know the runtime size and
//! alignment of the structure we are reading so that we can 
//! eventually cast the read bytes to a more useful type without
//! risking UB. The PmSized and ConstPmSized traits provide 
//! methods to calculate the runtime size and alignment alongside
//! the SpecPmSized trait (defined in pmem/pmcopy_t.rs) and check
//! that the calculated size is correct, which helps us ensure 
//! that proofs use the correct size for structures.
