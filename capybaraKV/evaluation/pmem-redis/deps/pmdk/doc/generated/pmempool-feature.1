\f[B]pmempool\-feature\f[] \- toggle or query pool set features
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ feature\ (\-e|\-d|\-q\ feature\-name)\ [options]\ <file>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool feature\f[] command enables / disables or queries pool
set features.
.PP
Available pool \f[I]feature\-names\f[] are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]SINGLEHDR\f[] \- only the first part in each replica contains the
pool part internal metadata.
This value can be used only with \f[B]\-q\f[].
It can not be enabled or disabled.
For details see \f[B]poolset\f[](5).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] \- only the first 2KiB of pool part internal
metadata is checksummed.
Other features may depend on this one to store additional metadata in
otherwise unused second 2KiB part of a header.
When \f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] is disabled whole 4KiB is checksummed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] \- enables additional check performed during
pool open which verifies pool consistency in the presence of dirty
shutdown.
\f[B]CHECKSUM_2K\f[] has to be enabled prior to \f[B]SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[]
otherwise enabling \f[B]SHUTDOWN_STATE\f[] will fail.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]CHECK_BAD_BLOCKS\f[] \- enables checking bad blocks performed
during opening a pool and fixing bad blocks performed by pmempool\-sync
during syncing a pool.
Currently (Linux kernel v4.19, libndctl v62) checking and fixing bad
blocks require read access to the following resource files (containing
physical addresses) of NVDIMM devices which only root can read by
default:
.IP

.PP
\f[C]\-e,\ \-\-enable\ feature\-name\f[]

.PP
\f[C]\-d,\ \-\-disable\ feature\-name\f[]
.PP
Disable feature for pool set.
.PP
