This is src/test/cto_reopen/README.

This directory contains a unit test for the libpmemcto library.
It verifies that there is no leak of the usable pool space between
pmemcto_close() and pmemcto_open().

The program in cto_reopen.c takes a filename and the number of close/open
cycles. For example:

	./cto_reopen testfile 16

will create (or open) a pmemcto pool on testfile, perform some number
of pmemcto_malloc()/pmemcto_free() operations and then close the pool.
It will repeat it 16 times.
