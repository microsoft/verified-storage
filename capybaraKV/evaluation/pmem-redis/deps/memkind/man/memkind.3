.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.BR memkind_error_message ()
converts an error number
.I err
returned by a member of the memkind
interface to an error message
.I msg
where the maximum size of the message is passed by the
.I size
parameter.

.B "HEAP MANAGMENT:"
.br
The functions described in this section define a heap manager with an
interface modeled on the ISO C standard API's, except that the user
must specify the
.I kind
of memory with the first argument to each function.  See the
.B KINDS
section below for a full description of the implemented kinds.
.PP
.BR memkind_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer
coercion) for storage of any type of object.  If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_malloc ()
returns  NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I num
objects each
.I size
bytes in length in memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The result is identical to calling
.BR memkind_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR num * size ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.
If
.I num
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.BR Note:
.BR memkind_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR memkind_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR memkind_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
with the same
.I kind
as specified to the call to
.BR memkind_realloc ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of memory of a specified
.I kind
such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_free ()
causes the allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. This pointer
must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was already called before, undefined behavior occurs.
If
.I ptr
is  NULL, no operation is performed.
The value of
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT
can be given as the
.I kind
for all buffers allocated by a kind that leverages the jemalloc
allocator.  This includes all internally defined kinds other than those
that use gigabyte pages.  In cases where the kind is unknown in the
context of the call to
.BR memkind_free ()
.B 0
can be given as the
.I kind
specified to
.BR memkind_free ()
but this will require a look up that can be bypassed by specifying
a non-zero value.
.sp
.B "ALLOCATOR CALLBACK FUNCTION:"
.br
This section describes the memkind interface which is used internally
by the heap manager.  For this API the kind is determined by the
partition index.  This enables the underlying heap manager to call
routines with standard type arguments, and allows the heap manager
implementation to be independent of the specifics of the
.I memkind_t
implementation.  Currently there is only one callback function.
.PP
.BR memkind_partition_mmap ()
which is a wrapper around the
.BR mmap (2)
system call.  The hint address
.I addr
and the length in bytes of the buffer to be
allocated
.I size
are passed through to
.BR mmap (2).
The other
.BR mmap (2)
parameters are determined by the kind operations.
.sp
.B "KIND MANAGEMENT:"
.br
There are built-in kinds that are always available, and these are enumerated in the
.B KINDS
section.  The user can also create their own kinds of memory.  This
section describes the API's that enable the tracking of the different
kinds of memory and determining their properties.
.PP
.BR memkind_create () (DEPRECATED)
is used to create a new kind of memory.  It takes as input a pointer
to a vtable called
.I ops
that determines the operations that define the kind of memory.  These
operations can be taken from one of the memkind built-in implementations
defined in the memkind headers, or it can be user implemented.  The requirements
for each operation is defined in the
.B MEMKIND OPERATIONS
section.  See the
.B SEE ALSO
section for the list of memkind header files that implement the built-in
operations: each header has a man page.
.PP
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
is a convenience function used to create a file-backed kind of memory.
It allocates a temporary file in the given directory
.IR dir .
The file is created in a fashion similar to
.BR tmpfile (3),
so that the file name does not appear when the directory is listed and
the space is automatically freed when the program terminates.
The file is truncated to a size of
.I max_size
bytes and the resulting space is memory-mapped.  Then, the actual pmem
.I kind
is created by calling
.BR memkind_create ()
with a unique
.I name
string ("pmemXXXXXXXX"), and the pointer to
.BR MEMKIND_PMEM_OPS
as
.I ops
argument.
.br
Note that the actual file system space is not allocated immediately, but only
on a call to
.BR memkind_pmem_mmap ()
(see
.BR memkind_pmem (3)).
This allows to create a pmem memkind of a pretty large size without the
need to reserve in advance the corresponding file system space for the entire
heap.  The minimum
.I max_size
value allowed by the library is defined in
.B <memkind_pmem.h>
as
.BR MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE .
Calling
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
with a size smaller than that will return an error.
The maximum allowed size is not limited by
.BR memkind ,
but by the file system specified by the
.I dir
argument.
The
.I max_size
passed in is the raw size of the memory pool and
.B jemalloc
will use some of that space for its own metadata.
.PP
.BR memkind_finalize ()
releases all resources associated with the memkind library including
the resources used by all of the kinds that were created, but it does
not free memory allocated with the
.B HEAP MANAGEMENT
interface.  This must be the last call to the memkind library before
application termination, but it can be called more than once.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_num_kind ()
sets
.I num_kind
to the number of available kinds of memory.  This accounts for
the built-in static kinds and any dynamically created kinds.
Since there is a one-to-one mapping between partitions and kinds,
this is also the number of partitions.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_partition ()
sets
.I kind
to the memory kind associated with the
.I partition
index which must be in the range [0,
.IR "num_kind" " - 1]"
where num_kind can be retrieved with the
.BR memkind_get_num_kind ()
function.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_name ()
sets
.I kind
to the memory kind associated with the
.I name
string specified.  All of the built-in kinds have name strings that are the lower-case version of name
given in the
.B KINDS
section (for example: MEMKIND_DEFAULT has
.I name
"memkind_default")
.PP
.BR memkind_get_size () (DEPRECATED)
sets
.I total
to the number of bytes on the system which can be allocated with the specified
.IR kind ,
and sets
.I free
to the number of unallocated bytes available of memory with the
specified
.IR kind.

.BR Note:
These numbers may be specific to the CPU of the calling
thread if the
.I kind
binds memory to NUMA nodes associated with the CPU.
.PP
.BR memkind_check_available ()
Returns a zero if the specified
.I kind
is available or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if it is not.
.sp
.B "DECORATORS:"
.br
The memkind library enables the user to define decorator functions that
can be called before and after each memkind heap management API.  The
decorators that are called at the beginning of the function end are named
after that function with
.I _pre
appended to the name, and those that are called at the end of the
function are named after that function with
.I _post
appended to the name.  These are weak symbols, and if they are not
present at link time they are not called.  The memkind library does
not define these symbols which are reserved for user definition.
These decorators can be used to track calls to the heap management
interface or to modify parameters.  The decorators that are called at
the beginning of the allocator pass all inputs by reference, and the
decorators that are called at the end of the allocator pass the output
by reference.  This enables the modification of the input and output
of each heap management function by the decorators.
.sp
.B "LIBRARY VERSION"
.br
The memkind library version scheme consist major, minor and patch numbers separated by dot. Combining those numbers, we got the following representation:
.br
major.minor.patch, where:
.br
	-major number is incremented whenever API is changed (loss of backward compatibility),
.br
	-minor number is incremented whenever additional extensions are introduced, or behavior has been changed,
.br
	-patch number is incremented whenever small bug fixes are added.
.sp
memkind library provide numeric representation of the version by exposing the following API:
.br
int memkind_get_version() return version number represented by a single integer number, obtained from the formula:
.br
major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch
.sp
Note: major < 1 means unstable API.
.sp
API standards:
.br
-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable
.br
-NON-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable, however this is not a standard way to use memkind
.br
-EXPERIMENTAL API, API is considered as unstable and the subject to change
.br
.sp
.B "MEMKIND OPERATIONS:"
.br
The
.I memkind_ops
structure is a vtable that defines the operations which determine the
kind of memory.  This design pattern is modeled after the "mix-in"
pattern used in the Linux kernel to enable some of the features of an
object oriented language in C.  This section defines the inputs,
outputs and responsibilities of each function pointer enumerated in the
.I memkind_ops
structure.  Each of these methods takes a
.B memkind_t
argument as its first parameter which shall be self referencing.  In this
documentation the function pointers in the
.I memkind_ops
structure will be prepended with
.RB """" ops. """"
and should be considered the operation associated with the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int ops.create(memkind_t " "kind" ", const struct memkind_ops " "*ops" ", const char " "*name" );
.br
shall instantiate all of the dynamic resources associated with the

It takes a pointer to the vtable structure
.I ops
which has a function pointer for each of methods defined in this section
of the man page.  If any methods are unnecessary to the implementation of
the
.I kind
these function pointers shall be set to
.BR NULL .
The
.I name
string is an input parameter that identifies the kind of memory so
that it can be fetched with the
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_name ()
function.  Typically this method is either a pointer to the function
.BR memkind_default_create ()
defined in
.IR <memkind_default.h> ,
or a function that calls
.BR memkind_default_create ()
before performing other setup.
.PP

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_malloc (),
and
.BR memkind_realloc (),
return the pointer to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request fails.
.BR memkind_free ()
and
.BR memkind_error_message ()
do not have return values.
All other memkind API's return 0 upon
success, and an error code defined in the ERRORS section upon failure.
The memkind library avoids setting
.I errno
directly, but calls to underlying libraries and system calls may set
.IR errno .
.SH "KINDS"
The available kinds of memory
.TP
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT
Default allocation using standard memory and default page size.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HUGETLB
Allocate from standard memory using huge pages. Note: This kind requires
huge pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_GBTLB
Allocate from standard memory using giga byte huge pages. Note: This kind
requires gigabyte pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_INTERLEAVE
Allocate pages interleaved across all NUMA nodes with transparent huge
pages disabled.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW
Allocate from the closest high bandwidth memory NUMA node at time
of allocation. If there is not enough high bandwidth memory to satisfy the request
.I errno
is set to ENOMEM and the allocated pointer is set to NULL.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB

.B MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED
except the allocation is backed by huge pages. Note: This kind requires huge pages
configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_GBTLB
Same as
.B MEMKIND_HBW
except the allocation is backed by one gigabyte huge pages.  Note that
.I size
can take on any value, but full gigabyte pages will allocated for each
request, so remainder of the last page will be wasted. A good use case
scenario is to grow a buffer in the course of an application with reallocs.
In this case, if there is enough memory available within in already allocated
gigabyte page, newer pages are not fetched. This is demonstrated in the
examples directory with gb_realloc_example.c
This kind requires gigabyte pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
section.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_GBTLB
Same as

except that if there is not enough high bandwidth memory to satisfy
the request, the allocation will fall back on standard memory. Note: This kind
requires gigabyte pages configuration described in SYSTEM CONFIGURATION section.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_INTERLEAVE

.B MEMKIND_HBW
except that the pages that support the allocation are interleaved
across all high bandwidth nodes and transparent huge pages are
disabled.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /usr/bin/memkind-hbw-nodes
Prints a comma separated list of high bandwidth nodes.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
This environment variable is a comma separated list of NUMA nodes that
are treated as high bandwidth. Uses the
.I libnuma
routine
.BR numa_parse_nodestring ()
for parsing, so the syntax described in the
.BR numa (3)
man page for this routine applies: e.g 1-3,5 is a valid setting.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND
This environment variable allows leveraging internal mechanism of
the library for setting number of arenas per kind. Value should be
a positive integer (not greater than INT_MAX defined in limits.h).
The user should set the value based on the characteristics
of application that is using the library. Higher value can
provide better performance in extremely multithreaded applications at
the cost of memory overhead. See section "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" of
.BR jemalloc (3)
for more details about arenas.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
Controls behavior of memkind with regards to returning memory to underlaying OS. Setting
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
to "1" causes memkind to not release memory to OS in anticipation of memory reuse soon. This will
improve latency of 'free' operations but increase memory usage.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
Controls logging mechanism in memkind. Setting
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
to "1" enables printing messages like errors and general informations about environment to
.I stderr.
.SH "SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
Interfaces for obtaining 2MB and 1GB pages (HUGETLB and GBTLB) need allocated
huge pages in the kernel's huge page pool.
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
Current number of "persistent" huge pages can be read from /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file.
Proposed way of setting hugepages is: "sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=<number_of_hugepages>".
More informations can be found here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
.TP
.B GBTLB (gigabyte pages)
Number of preallocated gigabyte pages can be read from /proc/cmdline
(hugepagesz=1G nr_hugepages=N). Setting gigabyte hugepages is available
by kernel commandline. From 3.16 and later kernels, users can allocate
gigabyte pages like its done for 2MB pages.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
There might be some overhead in huge pages consumption caused by heap management.
If your allocation fails because of OOM, please try to allocate extra huge pages (e.g. 8 huge pages).
