//! This file contains the trusted specification for how a persistent
//! memory region (implementing trait `PersistentMemoryRegion`)
//! behaves.
//!
//! One of the things it models is what can happen to a persistent
//! memory region if the system crashes in the middle of a write.
//! Specifically, it says that on a crash some subset of the
//! outstanding byte writes will be flushed (performed before the
//! crash) and the rest of the outstanding byte writes will be
//! discarded. Furthermore, any 8-byte-aligned 8-byte chunk either has
//! all its outstanding writes flushed or all of them discarded.
//!
//! Following Perennial, this model uses prophecy to describe the
//! current state of the persistent memory. The abstract state of the
//! storage consists of a read state, which doesn't use prophecy, and
//! a durable state, which does use prophecy.
//
//! The read state is straightforward: It reflects all writes done so
//! far, regardless of whether those writes have been made durable and
//! will survive a crash. So it reflects what future reads will see,
//! at least until the next crash terminates the Verus program.
//!
//! The durable state represents what state would result if a crash
//! happened now. It forms this representation by predicting, every
//! time a write occurs, which of the bytes in that write will be made
//! durable before the next crash. Of course, this prediction can't be
//! made in reality, but that doesn't stop us from making the
//! prediction in ghost state.
//!
//! The semantics of a flush is that, if you're calling flush right
//! now, the predictor must have predicted that all outstanding
//! written bytes would be flushed to persistent memory before the
//! next crash. So a *precondition* of a flush operation is that the
//! read state matches the durable state.
//!
//! Modeling with an omniscient predictor is naturally unrealistic.
//! But in Perennial, it's been proved that any program correct under
//! the prophecy model is correct under the traditional model of a
//! storage system. So the model is a reasonable and sound one.
//!
//! Another thing this file models is how bit corruption manifests,
//! in terms of a Hamming bound (i.e., total number of bits that could
//! be corrupted on read).
